# AutofacDemo
This repository contains MVC5 project. This project illustrates dependency injection using Autofac library.
It has custom Exception filter implementation which uses Property dependency injection. 
To achieve property injection open source library Autofac.Extras.Nlog package is used. 
This demo shows how custom modules created based on Autofac base module can be used to hack dependency injection in custom attributes.
(like it has done for Logger property in ExceptionHandler class)
